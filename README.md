# BitcoinKeyConverter

Converts hex format bitcoin private keys to WIF format safely, offline. Option to dump converted keys to file.
No real error handling, only 64 character hex format bitcoin keys are taken. I wrote it quickly for myself so I could parse a lot of keys safely offline instead of using a website like https://gobittest.appspot.com/PrivateKey. 

## Dependencies

*.NET Framework 4.8

Releases prior v0.13 utilise .NET Framework 4.6.1

## How to use

Instructions are given within the program. Only 64 character hex format private keys are accepted.
